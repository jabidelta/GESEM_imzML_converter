# GESEM_imzML_converter
mzml to imzml converter

With this sort of matlab functions we can create a bruker and shimadzu based imzml, from an MZML archive generated by msconvert Proteowizard.
The diferent test examples were created with the program excalibur(R) from Thermo raw format in our Orbitrap mass spectrometer.
We have a function which can also transform all the files contained in one folder to another.
Limitations:
Only can generate not compressed ibd files, in 32-bit or 64 bits float data formats.
